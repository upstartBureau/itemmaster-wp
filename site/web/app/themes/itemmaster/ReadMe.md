### itemMaster - WordPress Theme

Each page has it's own template:

* contact form
  `page-contact.php`
* brands (site index page)
  `page-brands.php`
* retailers
  `page-retailers.php`

Theme currently relies on the following plugins:

* [ACF - Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
* [Postman SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/)
* [Fast Secure Contact Form](https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-contact-form/)

__they will be located in the mu-plugins directory__

There should be no need to further customize the iM WordPress Theme, and so the editor has been disabled, content can be added to the existing pages, and any additional pages would need  templates created in order to be displayed.
